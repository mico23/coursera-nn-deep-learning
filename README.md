# Coursera - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This repository servers as my journal of studying Deep Learning instead of a Deep Learning projects. It contains all assignments, along with my notes, I have completed during the online course provided by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

Note: "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" is part of the deep learning specialization provided by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. The copy right of the coding materials belongs to deeplearning.ai.

## Content
