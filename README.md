# Coursera - Deep Learning Specialization
This repository servers as my journal of studying deep learning instead of a Deep Learning project. It contains the assignments I have completed, along with my own notes, during the online courses of Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

### W2 - Neural Networks Basics (Logistic Regression is used.)
### W3 - Planar Data Classification with a Hidden Layer
